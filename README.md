## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

We are using the React library to render the interface and Redux for state management. React is lightweight and unopinionated, so it's perfect for building an MVP.

#### Dependencies

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js used to send requests to our express backend
- [Firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase): Helper used to initalize our firebase authentication system
- [FirebaseImages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase): Storage for images uploads
- [Firebaseui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebaseui): Provides simple, customizable UI bindings on top of Firebase SDK to display login and signup forms
- [FontAwesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome): Allows us to use sleek icons on our application
- [Material-Ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core): Implement Google's Material Design, allows us to style components with built in styles 
- [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment): Lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates, used to format timestamps
- [Node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass): Allows you to natively compile .scss files to css at incredible speed and automatically via a connect middleware
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react): a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, used to create the boiler-plate for our application
- [React-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom):
- [React-loader-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom): Serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React
- [React-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux): Advanced state management system for React
- [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom): Collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with the application
- [React-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts): Configures boiler-plated scripts for react applications
- [React-test-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-test-renderer): Provides an experimental React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript 
- [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux): Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications
- [Redux-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-logger): Logs information in the console about redux actions and reducers
- [Redux-thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk): Allows us to write action creators that return a function instead of an action
- [Uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid): Simple, fast generation of RFC4122 UUIDS.


#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/rogercp/mechanic-backend) deployed to `Heroku`

We are using a PostgresSQL database deployed on Heroku. To access the database we are implementing a RESTful API using NodeJS, Express, and knex. Node lets you write JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end, which increases readability and reduced context-switching.

## APIs

#### Authentication API - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

This API is used to authenticate the individuals, mediators and admin to log into the system using their email and password. It handles identity related tasks.


#### Email API - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/)

SendGrid allows us to send secure emails. For example when a user forgets their password and needs to reset or when they need to receive email reminders or notifications.


#### Intergration Testing API - [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html)

This API enables end to end intergration testing. A fake web browser is set up, and Cypress runs the tests live while showing you what happens every step of the way. It can also take screen shots and recordings when unexpected behavior is found. 

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_API_URL - the Backend URL.
    *  REACT_APP_URL - the url used to dynamically pass in callbacks, and redirects
